# Website-Template-Hackathon
This is a basic Django-Blog App that may serve as the basis for other websites. 

## Description
Best practices would be to create a virtual environmnet, clone the repository, and run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to grab all the requirements. 
You can use virtualenvwrapper:
https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html

To run the web app locally, go to the main project file and run `py manage.py runserver` on Windows or `python3 manage.py runserver` on Mac and Linux. Then go to 127.0.0.1 in your browser of choice. 

## Credits
This project is a result of running through the first 8 videos of Corey Schafer's Youtube Django Tutorials, an amazing resource for those interested in Django development. His whole Youtube channel is fantastic. Link https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmljXZIypDc&list=PL-osiE80TeTtoQCKZ03TU5fNfx2UY6U4p
